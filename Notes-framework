# 🧱 Frameworks in Software Development

## 📌 What is a Framework?

A **framework** is a software tool used to create prototypes and build applications efficiently. It provides **pre-built components and features** that help developers avoid writing repetitive code, allowing them to focus on the unique parts of their project.

Frameworks are one of the **important pillars** in project-driven development, offering structure, speed, and scalability.

## 🧩 Types of Frameworks

Frameworks can be broadly categorized into:

### 🔷 Major Frameworks
These are **full-stack frameworks** that provide everything needed for large-scale application development.

- **Django**
- **Pyramid**

### 🔹 Minor Frameworks
These are **micro-frameworks** that offer only the essentials, giving developers more flexibility.

- **Flask**

## 🚀 Benefits of Using Frameworks

- Saves development time
- Provides built-in tools and libraries
- Encourages best practices and clean architecture
- Improves code maintainability
- Helpful for both beginners and experienced developers

## 🌐 Django and N-Tier Architecture

**Django** is a major framework that follows **N-tier architecture** for building dynamic web applications.

### 🏗️ What is N-Tier Architecture?

N-tier architecture separates an application into multiple layers:

| Layer               | Description                          | Technologies Used         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Presentation Layer** | User interface                      | HTML, CSS, JavaScript     |
| **Business Logic Layer** | Application logic                  | Python (Django views)     |
| **Data Layer**         | Data storage and retrieval         | SQL, Django ORM           |

> **Architecture** refers to the structural design or blueprint of a software project.

> **Project** in Django is a container that holds multiple apps and configurations used to build a complete software system.

## 🧠 Basic Concepts

### 🔸 What is Software?

**Software** is a collection of programs that control hardware and perform specific tasks.

### 🔸 Types of Software

1. **System Software**  
   - Controls system-level operations  
   - Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS

2. **Application Software**  
   - Performs specific user tasks  
   - Examples: Calculator, MS Paint, Offline Games

### 🔸 Types of Application Software

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Client-Server / Web-Based** | Requires internet and server interaction | Gmail, Online Banking |
| **Standalone** | Works without internet | Calculator, MS Paint, Offline Games |
